              passionate about building excellent software that make a
              difference. I have a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in
              Electrical Electronics, but have real passion for programming and
              web development, where I specialize in creating unique,
              market-centric, informative websites that put my clients above
              their competitors, ranging from individuals and small businesses
              all the way to large enterprice corporations.

              determination to exceed my clients expectations. My process is
              very collaborative. I like to involve my clients closely in every
              stage of the project, listening and fully understanding their
              requirements so as to deliver an online solution that meets their
              business goals.
